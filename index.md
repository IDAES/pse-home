The Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems (IDAES) Process Engineering Platform has spawned a number of projects that are directly related to the platform as well as a number of related projects.

## IDAES core projects

### IDAES 
The IDAES integrated platform utilizes the most advanced computational algorithms to enable the design and optimization of complex, interacting energy and process systems from individual plant components to the entire electrical grid.
